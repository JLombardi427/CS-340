>> I think one of the best ways you can write a program that has the characteristics of being maintainable, readable, and adaptable is by writing a program that solves problems and is tested with edge cases. I believe that edge case testing allows the mindset of "a user can do x, y, and z, but they cannot do anything that will break it". This way it gives the programmer control to either add to these rules, or lift the rules in the future. For example, if I desing a program that is able to find a query or an object in a databse, well I completed a first step to add the update and delte function because in order to do those actions, we first must be able to find the object before we update or delete. Starting small and growing the project allows for a small MVP goal and then the expansion is the stretch or nice to have.
>> I truly believe that computer scientists are problem solvers. We are given a problem or assignment, and we need to find the best solution to this ask. They come in various roles and shapes and forms, but in the end they are solving problems. I think that this project helps a company like Grazioso Salvare because it creates the queries, it finds the data, and displays it in a professional way that will hopefully bring efficiency to the company.
